Remove dagger-android (Steps)

 1 - remove dagger android

 2 - refactor to use FragmentFactory to provide all fragments.
     Now we can do constructor injection in fragments

 3 - remove MainDependencyProvider ( was a work-around for dagger android )

 4 - Create custom NavHostFragment for each "feature" (auth, account, blog, create_blog)
